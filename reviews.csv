purchase is quit good and great delivery","After 15 days review:I purchased this blaupunkt over headphones for my office use, it's fits perfectly on my ears and look is very attractive.Quality of the product is nice. Great with Bluetooth connection. 10 min charge gets 100% battery backup and noise cancellation is not upto the things that expecting.I'm not a gaming person, am using for listening music and watching videos with great sound. Overall features satisfactory. I'm happy with the product.",1.0,True

The finest headphones one can buy at this cost.","Excellent value for the money, and seemingly of higher quality than competing Chinese brands out there.Since I'm using it wirelessly, the sound is of high quality and the Bluetooth connection is stable.The plastic construction appears to be fine, but you should handle it with care because it seems fragile. While the ear cups may be a little snug, for the price, you really can't beat the noise isolation though.The battery life of this set of headphones is significantly better and long-lasting, and they are charged via a USB type C connector.  The quality of the music I am currently experiencing is, quite simply, astounding. Gotta listen to feel it.After a long time of frustration trying to find good music headphones that weren't from the same Chinese brand starts with ""B"" that rows the same BOAT of pains, I have to say that my overall experience with this Blaupunkt Headphone BH31 has been greatly positive. Hope they will continue to maintain their high standards. Thanks!",5.0,True

No metal are used as per product description. Extra Bass supressing other sounds.","1. No metal are used as per product description. Average button Quality and plastic used. *2. BAss is so much prominent that afer unselecting all options of BASS in media player Still Ear Hurts at 40% sound.3. Listening OLD melody song in this BASS , flute, SITAR, etc , all other such tune decreased in front of Drums, Dholl etc.4. Bluetooth range is OK, EAR cups are soft and covers whole ear gives extra protection from outer noise.5.  after 1or 1.30 Hr, ear gets heated .  Please do something for EXTRA BASS it ruiens old songs, gazals .......",2.0,True
